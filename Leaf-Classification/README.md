Leaf Classification
We Used  10 classification technique and printing their results. These will perform much better after tuning their Hyperparameters, this gives you a decent ballpark idea.

- KNeighborsClassifier
- SVC(Support Vector Classifier)
- NuSVC(Nu-Support Vector Classification)Similar to SVC but uses a parameter to control the number of support vectors. The implementation is based on libsvm.
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier
- AdaBoostClassifier
- GradientBoostingClassifier
- GaussianNB
- LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
- QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis
